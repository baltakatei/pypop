# ðŸ›Ž Proof of Ping

An implementation of a distance-bounding protocol


## Objective

Create a `python3` script that enables a user to calculate the an upper bound of physical distance to another user using time-of-flight and the speed of light.


## Background

It is possible using round-trip time (ping time) between a Verifier and a Prover and the assumption that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light in order to calculate an upper bound for distance between the Verifier and Prover.

Such a distance-bounding method is described in the [Hancke-Kuhn Protocol][hancke_2005_dbp]. See this [explanation of this protocol](http://reboil.com/blog/0020190815T064636Z..hancke-kuhn_dbp_explanation.html).


## Method

This project will implement the [Hancke-Khun distance-bounding protocol][hancke_2005_dbp] in `python3`.
