This project is to create a python program to create a
distance-bounding proof.

Reference 1. A paper outlining minimum required bit operations to
implement distance-bounding proof ([link][hancke_2005_dbp])

Reference 2. Sending and receiving UDP packets in python ([link][eforbes_20170415_udppython])

Reference 3. Wikipedia article on distance-bounding protocol ([link][wp_2019_dbp])

I created a separate readme.md file to store background information
describing the Hancke-Kuhn protocol in my own terms. Equations are
encoded in MathML (viewable in default Firefox).

`github.com` MathML support in their Markdown renderer does not function
correctly. Excising "Background section" from `readme.md` and moving
content into `background.md` in `DOCS/` directory and generating
`background.html` using Markdown 1.0.1 ("Copyright 2004 John Gruber").

Found that github.com doesn't support easily hosting HTML
files. Changed readme.md to point to background at statically-hosted
site.
